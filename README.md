# The Policy Project (working title)
## Overview
This project hopes to brainstorm and design solutions to 1. make governmental policy known 2. track the development of policy and as political positions change or don't change, 3. allow for easy comparison of policy. What people should walk away with from this solution is 1. an understanding of what someone plans to do in their position of power, 2. understand how their position has changed over the years, 3. understand the difference between policies.

This project is an ongoing one to develop the space around political knowledge and transparency. We deserve better leaders in this world.

## FAQ

### Q. Why? 
#### A. Please consider the following analogies:
- When you shop for something, you look up the price, the description, the ratings, you compare similar products together. You hope to make a well informed decision. You hope that product benefits you the way you expect it to. The same should be with the people whom we elect to run our governments big and small. You should expect to clearly see everything a politician stands for and understand what they intend to do to better your life.
- When you go in for a job interview, the interviewer asks for your qualifications, and why they think you are good for the job. You hand them a resume that has been carefully constructed to convey your qualifications. Why is it not the same with politicians?
- When apply for college, your grades from high school are considered, your SAT/ACT test scores are considered, your extra curricular activities are considered. Why is it not the same for politicians?

### Q. How will it work?
#### A. To be honest, I don't know fully. And that's what I need your help with. 
I have some ideas which you can find in this project, but ideas and feedback are greatly appreciated. 

In short, I imagine a website where politicians and candidates publish their policies on different topics (Economy, Health Care, Supreme Court Appointments, etc). This information is set in stone, but revisions can be made. All revisions are tracked and the public can see how policies change over time. Everyone can see how a candidate's position has changed over time, or how a candidate's position differs from another candidate's. Candidates and politicians need accountability for their leadership position.

### Q. Who is this for?
#### A. This project is for anyone wishes there was more transparency in politics, and being able to make a well informed decision on who should run positions of power.
- this is for candidates to display their policies on public record in a central place designed for transparency and clarity.
- this is for voters to compare and contrast their candidates.
- this is for the public to hold their politicians accountable to the things they promise during campaigns.

### Q. Why does this matter?
#### A. This matters because the world needs better leaders. 
Theres a reason why politicians have bad reputations as being sleazy, lying, and shifty. It is because too many politicians are known for abusing their power to gain fame or fortune. It is because too many politicians focus on votes rather than policy. They are all too willing to shift political policy to secure votes. The Founding Fathers of the United States Constitution understood that a voting democracy only exists if its voters are well informed and free to share and discuss political opinion or otherwise. This is why the First Amendment was enacted. The first amendment literally secures our right to gather, to discuss, to form policy, and to right wrongs through policy and law.  


## Hypothetical Press Release
Starting this next voting season, a brand new website will now be required for all candidates running for the Democratic and Republican party. Both sides agreed that this new site would aid in transparency for the voting public. All candidates will be asked to create a verified account, and post their policies on key topics such as economy, jobs, health care, immigration, gun policy, foreign policy, climate change, abortion, race and inequality, supreme court appointments and much more. The site is designed for voters to see how a given candidate's policy changes over time and how it compares against another candidate. Revisions to policies are tracked over time, and while making revisions are certainly not a bad thing, making too many revisions can be a sign that the candidate is adjusting its policy just to win votes over their opponent. Analysts say this new mechanism of conveying political information is bringing control back to the voter, and giving a newfound sense of accountability to all.
